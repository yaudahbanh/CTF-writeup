# hike to where?
> Where was this photo taken? I think it used to be in the original photo, but someone cropped it out!
The flag is lactf{location}, where location is the name of the POI that this person hiked up to, all lowercase and replacing spaces with underscrolls. Use the google maps name of the POI: for example, if the solution is the UCLA Bruin Bear statue, this is the google maps location, and the flag would be lactf{bruin_statue}.

## Solve

This photo is cropped, the only clue is text at the photo, which is there a hiking event and one of student or lecturer is participate on this event.

First, i look about lecturer, there a website who's have information for lecturer at Computer Science UCLA.
`https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/browse/Departments/ComputerScience/Faculty-Roster`

And I found the lecturer which is same person `Carey S. Nachenberg, MS`

Then i googled like this `Carey Nachenberg hiking` and found this

So yeah the flag was 
```
lactf{skull_rock}
```
